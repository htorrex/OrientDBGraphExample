OrientDBGraphExample
====================

Very basic OrientDB Graph Example


Create an empty maven application project and import with existing code.
We will be using snapshot version of OrientDB Graph Edition as it seems it is the only way to get it via maven.
Try to build the project and make sure that all dependencies are downloaded. And then we can start with the actual code.
